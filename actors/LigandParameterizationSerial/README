LigandParameterizationSerial Workflow - 1.0

Parameters
    c  overall charge of the small ligand. Default is 0 which means the small molecule is neutral.
    l  Ligand name.
    d  Directory where the small molecule pdb is located and where all the sequential jobs will be executed.

GENERAL: This workflow parameterizes one ligand in a serial fashion. Output are ligand parameters written in Amber formats. 

CAUTION: It is highly recommended that users check the source codes under String Constant before running the workflow to ensure that the commands to execute tleap are suitable for userâ€™s systems.

The input of this workflow should be a single pdb file for which the file name is a variable under the parameter l (ligand name).
