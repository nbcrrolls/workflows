Purpose
   This workflow incorporates the experimental status of a compound, i.e. binder or non-binder, the docking 
   score of the compound in each receptor ensemble member, and returns the ensemble best able to discriminate 
   known binders from known non-binders. Two CSV input files are required for this actor/workflow because 
   out of the four algorithm used to perform the statistical calculations, two required nonbonding events 
   to be represented as 0 and the other two required them to be represented as 9999999. For more information 
   about this actor/workflow, please refer back to “Progress towards automated Kepler scientific workflows 
   for computer-aided drug discovery and molecular simulations” section 3.7.
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   MATLAB R2013b or above
   MATLAB Parallelizing license (OPTIONAL)
Parameters
   d      This is the directory where the input CSV file should be located and output files will be saved. 
          The two CSV files should be in this user specific directory.  
          
   n      User specifies the number of ensemble receptor structures. For example, if user wants the best two 
          ensemble receptor structures out of the eight structures they used for virtual screening, they will 
          specify 2 for this parameter. 
          
   high   This is the name for the CSV file that contains 999999 to represent non-binding events.
   
   zero   This is the name for the CSV file that contains 0 to represent non-binding events.
Overview
   none
Usage
   There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, 
   users can double click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way 
   is to run Kepler through command lines.
