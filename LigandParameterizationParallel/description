   Parameterization
Purpose
   This workflow parameterize small molecules in parallel. It takes a list of pdb files stored in a local directory and creates corresponding sub-directories using the pdb file names. Parameterization of each small molecule will be done on corresponding sub-directories using Antechamber, tleap by Amber and Gaussian09. The final output is a new pdb file named LIGAND_NAME-new.pdb which can be used for any further experiments and for validations.
Required Software:
    Kepler 2.4 or above
    Gaussian09
    AmberTools 12 or above 
Parameters
    c   charge of the small molecules. All the small molecules have to have the same charges. Default is 0 which means all the small molecules are neutral.
    d   directory of the small molecule pdb files.
    p   pattern of the pdb files. Default is .*pdb$$ which means all the pdb files in the directory.
    p2  pattern of the pdb file to be replaced by empty string in order to obtain only the ligand name. Default is .pdb which means that LIGAND_NAME.pdb will turn into LIGAND_NAME
    n   the number of pdb that is going to parameterize in a single run. For example, if user has five small molecules in a single directory that need to parameterize, n will be set to five.

Usage
    There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, users can double click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way is to run Kepler through command lines. It is highly recommended that users check the source codes under String Constant inside Parameterization Actor before running the workflow to ensure that the commands to execute tleap are suitable for unique systems.
