   Parameterization
Purpose
   This workflow parameterize small molecules in parallel. It takes a list of pdb files stored in a local directory 
   and creates corresponding sub-directories using the pdb file names. Parameterization of each small molecule will 
   be done on corresponding sub-directories using Antechamber, tleap by Amber and Gaussian09. The final output is a 
   new pdb file named LIGAND_NAME-new.pdb which can be used for any further experiments and for validations.
Required Software:
    Kepler 2.4 or above
    Gaussian09
    AmberTools 12 or above 
Overview
    none
Usage
    There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, 
    users can double click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way is 
    to run Kepler through command lines. It is highly recommended that users check the source codes under String 
    Constant inside Parameterization Actor before running the workflow to ensure that the commands to execute 
    tleap are suitable for unique systems.
