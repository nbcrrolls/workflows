Description
    This workflow runs molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on the Amber GPU code. It can run in
    different platforms including on a local machine with a single GPU card or on remote GPU
    clusters. It takes a system's toplogy and coordinate files along with Amber input scripts
    and runs minimization, equlibration, and simulations all in one go. It also generates
    energy, temperature, pressure, RMSD plots for analysis purpose.
Required Software
    Kepler 2.4 or above
    bioKepler 1.2 or above
    Amber15 or above
    AmberTools 15 or above
    R 3.2.4 or above
Parameters
    ExecutionChoice    This parameter gives the option to run same workflow either on a local
                       machine or in a GPU cluster.
    NP                 The number of CPU processors for the minimization steps. It is the same
                       number of processors for each of the step.
    CMPD               The folder name containing the topology and coordinate files. The folder
                       name needs to match the stem name of the topology and coordinate file.
    AMBERHOME_local    $AMBERHOME/bin on your local machine. This should be the path that points
                       to where pmemd.MPI is located.
    inputFolder        The inputFolder path on your local machine. It is the directory where the
                       confDir and CMPD folder is located. An absolute path is required.
    TargetHost         The remote cluster login.
    IdentityFile       The identity file (id_rsa) that allows remote access. A complete and
                       absolute path is required.
    remoteDir          Work Directory on remote GPU cluster. A complete and absolute path is
                       required.
    numOfJobs          This parameter will allow "n" production jobs to be submitted in parallel
                       for a single system. This parameter is only for job submissions in GPU
                       clusters
    AMBERHOME_cpu      $AMBERHOME on remote cluster on CPU nodes.
    AMBERHOME_gpu      $AMBERHOME on remote cluster on GPU nodes.
    cpuModulesToLoad   Modules dynamically modifies a user’s execution environment to configure
                       the shell for an application.
    gpuModulesToLoad   The parameter “gpuModulesToload” prepares execution environment on GPU
                       nodes on a cluster.
    t-cpu              Time requests for each of the minimization step in the remote cluster.
    t-gpu              Time requests for the heating step, equilibration steps and production step
                       in the remote cluster.
