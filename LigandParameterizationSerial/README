LigandParameterizationSerial 

Version
    1.0

Parameters
    c  overall charge of the small ligand. Default is 0 which means the small molecule is neutral.
    l  Ligand name.
    d  Directory where the small molecule pdb is located and where all the sequential jobs will be executed.    
       This is also the directory where the input pdb file should be located and where the outputs will be 
       stored.
    n  Number of processors for running gaussian 09
    m  Amount of RAM memory allocated for running gaussian 09 (in gigabyte)

General
    This workflow parameterizes one ligand in a serial fashion. Output are ligand parameters written in 
    Amber formats. 

Input & Output   
    The input for the workflow is a single ligand pdb file and output are LIGAND_NAME.prepc (Amber 
    parameters), LIGAND_NAME.frcmod (Amber check file) and LIGAND_NAME-new.pdb file 
    (built from Amber parameters).Sample input and outputs are available and included as a part
    of the download. They are in the input and output folders, respectively.

Operation System Requirement
    Linux

Caution
    It is highly recommended that users check the source codes under String Constant before running the 
    workflow to ensure that the commands to execute tleap are suitable for user's systems.
    The input of this workflow should be a single pdb file for which the file name is a variable under 
    the parameter l (ligand name).
