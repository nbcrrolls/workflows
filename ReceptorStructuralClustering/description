Description
   This workflow enables users to input simulations trajectories and to use gromos clustering method 
   to cluster structures based on rmsd similarity
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   AmberTools 14 
Parameters
   dd  Trajectories directory. This should be the full path to the trajectories directory. 
       A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   dp  Trajectories pattern. Pattern examples: .*pdb$$ (all pdb files in the trajectories directory), 
       .*nc$$ (all nc files), .*mdcrd$$ (all mdcrd files), .*dcd$$ (all dcd files), .+size.*$$ (all files that 
       contain size in the middle), and Size.*$$ (all files that contains Size in the begining).
       NOTE: if a user is running the workflow on a command prompt, the trajectory pattern is slightly
       different. For example, *.dcd$$ for (all dcd files) and *.nc$$ for (all nc files).

   p   Location of the topology file. This should be a full path to the topology file including the
       topology file. For example: [PATH]/p53_wt.top. A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   wd  Path of the work directory. This is where all the intermediate files and output files are stored. 
       A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   cd  Name of the trajectory file which will contain all of the input trajectories. Default name is 
       _CLUSTER_CAT_ALL.mdcrd

   rd  Residue id. When creating the input for gromos clustering, user can choose to keep only certain trajectory 
       structures. For example, if a user wants to keep the protein and strip everything else in a trajectory, 
       the user will need to specify the protein residue id that are intended to keep. This naming convention 
       follows Amber mask convention. For example, if the protein in the trajectories is residue numbers 1 to 194, 
       users will input :1-194. 

   as  Atom selection. This flag specifies which atoms or residues that clustering will be based on. Default value 
       is all alpha carbons. This flag naming convention follows Amber mask convention. 

   f   First frame. Users can choose to have a set number of frames for gromos clustering. Default value is the 
       first frame.

   l   Last frame. Users can choose to have a set number of frames for gromos clustering. Default value is 999999999.

   s   Stride. Users can choose to have a set number of frames for gromos clustering. Default value is 1, no stride. 
       2 will mean every other frame. 

   cf  Cutoff. This is the RMSD cutoff for gromos clustering. A very small rmsd cutoff will cause the program to fail. 

   ac  True or False. If true, alignment will be done on alpha carbon. If false, alignment will be done on the atoms 
       selected also for clustering. Default is False.
Overview

Usage
   There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, 
   users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way 
   is to run Kepler via a command line. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMANDED TO RUN THIS WORKFLOW USING THE KEPLER GUI.
   To run the workflow using GUI, start the kepler.sh file from where user installed Kepler by typing 

   /PATH/kepler.sh 
  
   in a terminal. For more information, please revisit the Kepler project website.
   To run the clustering workflow using command line, for example: 
   /PATH/./kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -dd -dp -p -wd -cd -rd -ac -as -f -l -s -cf PATH_TO _KAR/kar_file 
   When using default values, a user does not need to include the corresponding flags when typing in command prompt.
   Here is an example run:
   [all in one line] Kepler -runwf -nogui -dd /home/input/ -p /home/input/p53_wt.top -wd /home/output/ -dp *.dcd$$ 
   /home/Desktop/NBCR_Meetings/ReceptorStructuralClustering_1.0.kar
