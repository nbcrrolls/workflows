GROMOSCLUSTESRING Workflow 

VERISON 1.0.0

NOTES: This clustering workflow was built with Kepler actors. Amber tool – cpptraj – is required to run the workflow. Please make sure cpptraj is installed and the path to cpptraj is stored in bash file. Amber13 tools is licensed under GNU (General Public License) and is free to the general public. You can download cpptraj in the Amber website “http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools”. Gromos clustering is done on the NBCR (National Biomedical Computation Resource) web server. More available software provide by NBCR can be found in the following link “http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/opal2/dashboard?command=serviceList”.

WHERE INPUTS COME FROM: Input for this workflow should be trajectories from Molecular Dynamic Simulations. Currently, nc files, mdcrd files, dcd files can be accpted as input. 

OUTPUTS: This workflow will create multiple outputs including a log file which contains the number of cluster, a tar files with all the outputs generated by Gromos and trajectory files (pdb.gz, pdb and mdcrd) named under _CLUSTER_....
