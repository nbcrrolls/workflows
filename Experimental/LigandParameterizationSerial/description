Description
   This workflow parameterizes small molecules and uses antechamber (Amber) and Gaussian09 to calculate electrostatic 
   potential. Amber suite and Gaussian09 must be installed in order to run this workflow. The output includes 
   a new pdb file named LIGAND_NAME-new.pdb, prepc and frcmod files which can be used for any further experiment.
Required Software
    Kepler 2.4 or above
    Gaussian09
    AmberTools 12 or above
Parameters
    c  overall charge of the small ligand. Default is 0 which means the small molecule is neutral.

    l  Ligand name.

    d  Directory with the small molecule pdb and where all the sequential jobs will be executed.
       This is also the directory where the input pdb file should be located and where the outputs will be stored.

    n  Number of processors for running gaussian 09

    m  Amount of RAM memory allocated for running gaussian 09 (in gigabyte)
Overview
    None
Usage
    There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is 
	opened, users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. 
	Another way is to run Kepler via a command line. 
        for example: kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -c -l -d -n -m /PATH/workflow.kar
        kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -c 0 -l DM0 -d /home/test -n 8 -m 40 /home/LigandParameterizationSerial_1.0.kar
        It is highly recommended that users check the values 
	under String Constant before running the workflow to ensure that the commands to execute tleap are 
	suitable for unique systems.
