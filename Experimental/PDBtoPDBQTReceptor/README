PDBtoPDBQTReceptor

Version
   1.0

Purpose
   This workflow uses the NBCR opal server to run the pdb-to-pdbqt function implemented in 
   Autodock. Users does not need to have Autodock installed in their local machines. Receptor 
   pdb files are converted into receptor pdbqt files using the workflow. Outputs are displayed 
   in user default web browser and are downloaded into the directory listed under Path.

Parameters
    i     This is the input pdb file of interest. Users must supply the path to the pdb file
          and the receptor pdb file. A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required
    o     This is the name for the output pdbqt file. Only the name is necessary.
    Path  This is the directory where all outputs will be downloaded and stored.
          A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

Input & Output   
    Input is a receptor pdb file and output is a receptor pdbqt file. Sample inputs and outputs are 
    available and included as a part of the download. They are in the input and output folders, 
    respectively.

Operation System Requirement
    Linux

Notes
    The input of this workflow should be a single pdb file. This workflow only support 
    receptor/protein pdb file, no ligand pdb file is accepted.
