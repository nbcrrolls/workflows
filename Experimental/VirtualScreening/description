Description
   This workflow takes a list of receptor and ligand PDBs from a receptor directory and a ligand directory 
   respectively and converts them to Vina input files (PDBQT). Each receptor is paired with a ligand to 
   create an N(number of ligands) x M(number of receptors) matrix. Each pair of inputs will pass to 
   Vina for docking. Users can choose by clicking on the Vina actor to either run Vina locally or on the 
   NBCR web server.
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   biokepler 1.0 or above
   MGLTools 1.5.6
Parameters
   rd    Full path to the directory which contains all the receptors of interest. 
         Receptor and ligand directories should be different. 
         A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   ld    Full path to the directory which contains all the ligands of interest. 
         Receptor and ligand directories should be different. 
         A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   od    Full path to the directory where all the docking outputs will be stored.	
         A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   mgld  Directory where the MGLtools are installed.  For example, "/home/users/mgltoos/".
         A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   center_x   The center (x-axis) of the grid box.

   center_y   The center (y-axis) of the grid box.

   center_z   The center (z-axis) of the grid box.

   size_x     The length of the grid box extended from the x-axis center.

   size_y     The length of the grid box extended from the y-axis center

   size_z     The length of the grid box extended from the z-axis center.

Overview
   None
Usage
   There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is 
   opened, users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. 
   Another way is to run Kepler via a command line. 
   [all in one line] kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -rd -ld -od -mgld -center_x -center_y -center_z -size_x 
   -size_y -size_z /Path/workflow.kar
   For example:
   kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -rd /p/receptors/ -ld /p/ligands/ -od /p/output/ -mgld /p/mglt/ /p/VS_workflow.kar
