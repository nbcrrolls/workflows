Description
   This workflow incorporates the experimental status of a compound, i.e. binder or non-binder, the docking 
   score of the compound in each receptor ensemble member, and returns the ensemble best able to discriminate 
   known binders from known non-binders. Two CSV input files are required for this workflow because 
   out of the four algorithms used for the statistical calculations, two require nonbonding events 
   to be represented as 0 and the other two require them to be represented as 9999999. For more information 
   about this workflow, please refer back to "Progress towards automated Kepler scientific workflows 
   for computer-aided drug discovery and molecular simulations" section 3.7.
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   MATLAB R2013b or above
   MATLAB Parallelizing license
Parameters
   d      This is the directory for the input CSV files and the output files. 
          A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   n      Number of ensemble receptor structures. For example, if user wants the best 2 
          ensemble receptor structures out of the 8 structures they used for virtual 
 	  screening, they will specify 2. 
          
   high   Name for the CSV file that contains 999999 to represent non-binding events.
   
   zero   Name for the CSV file that contains 0 to represent non-binding events.

   c 	  Number of processors request. This workflow required users to have the MATLAB parallel lisence
          installed and this command requests the number of CPU processors for running the statistic jobs.
Overview
   None
Usage
   There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, 
   users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way 
   is to run Kepler via a command line. 
   For example: kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -d -n -high -zero -c /PATH/workflow.kar
   [all in one line] kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -d /home/input/ -n 2 -high all_conformations_high.csv -zero 
   all_conformations_zeros.csv -c 2 /home/VSPerformanceStatistic.kar
