Description
   This workflow parameterizes small molecules in parallel. It takes a list of pdb files stored in a local directory 
   and creates corresponding sub-directories using the pdb file names. Parameterization of each small molecule will 
   be done on corresponding sub-directories using Amber tools (antechamber, tleap) and Gaussian09. The final output is a 
   new pdb file named LIGAND_NAME-new.pdb which can be used for any further experiments and for validations.
Required Software
    Kepler 2.4 or above
    Gaussian09
    AmberTools 12 or above 
Parameters
    c   charge of the small molecules. All the small molecules must have the same charges. Default is 0 which 
        means all the small molecules are neutral. for example, 0

    d   directory with the small molecule pdb files. IT MUST BE COMPLETE PATH, for example /home/user/test

    p   pattern of the pdb files. Default is .*pdb$$ which means all the pdb files in the directory. When running
        this parameter using command line, usuer needs to put an escape character before all the irregular characters.
        For example: instead of .*pdb$$, user should type .\*pdb\$\$ when entering on a command line.

    p2  pattern of the pdb file to be replaced by empty string in order to obtain only the ligand name. Default 
        is .pdb which means that LIGAND_NAME.pdb will turn into LIGAND_NAME

    n   the number of pdbs to parameterize in a single run. For example, if user has five small molecules 
	    in a single directory that need to parameterize, n will be set to 5. 

    np  number of processors allocated for each ligand Gaussian09, for example 2

    m   memories in megabyte (MB) allocated for each ligand when running Gaussian09, for example 1000

Usage
    There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow is opened, 
    users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to start. Another way is 
    to run Kepler via a command line. Before starting the workflow, users should check the values in StringConstant 
    inside Parameterization Actor before running the workflow to ensure that the commands to execute tleap are suitable 
    for unique systems.
    To run it on command line, for example:
    /PATH/kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -c -d -p -p2 -n -np -m /PATH/workflow.kar
    [all in one line] /home/kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -c 0 -d /home/test/input -p .\*pdb\$\$ -p2 .pdb -n 5 -np 2
    -m 1000 /home/test/LigandParameterizationParallel_1.0.kar
