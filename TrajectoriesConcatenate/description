Description
   This workflow takes series of trajectories and concatenates them into one trajectory file named 
   _TRAJ_CONCAT_VMD_(TIME_THE_FILE_IS_CREATED)
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   VMD 1.9.1 or above
Parameters
   pa   Pattern. Default value is .*dcd$$ which will list all the .dcd files in the 
        assigned directory. NOTE: if a user is running the workflow on a command prompt, the trajectory 
        pattern is slightly different. For example, *.dcd$$ for (all dcd files) and *.nc$$ for (all nc 
        files).

   d    Directory. This should be a full path to the directory where all .dcd files are located.
        A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required. NOTE: this is always where the output files 
        (_TRAJ_CONCAT_VMD_(TIME_THE_FILE_IS_CREATED)) will be located. 

   p    Topology file. This should be a full path of the toplogy file. For example, DIRECTORY/XXX.prmtop.
        A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required

   pt   Topology type. Acceptable values are parm7 for Amber topology files and psf for 
        CHARMM topology files. Default value is parm7.

   tt   Trajectory type. Acceptable values are dcd for NAMD trajectories and pdb for PDB 
        files. Default value is dcd.

   ot   Output trajectory type, indicates the desired type of output trajectories.  Default value is dcd.

   f    First frame. This parameter tells VMD where to start extrapolating trajectories. It will apply 
        to all the individual trajectory files. Default is 0 (starting from the first frame)

   l    Last frame. This parameter tells VMD where to stop extrapolating trajectories. It will apply 
        to all the individual trajectory files. Default is -1 (ending at the last frame)

   s    Stride. This parameter tells VMD how many frames to be strided. For example, s = 2 means take 
        every other frames, while s = 1 means to take all the frames. Default is 1.
Overview
   None
Usage
   There are two ways to run this workflow. One is through the graphic interface. After the workflow 
   is opened, users can double-click the parameters to change their values and press the play button to 
   start. Another way is to run Kepler via a command line. For example:
   [PATH]/kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -pa -d -p -pt -tt -ot -f -l -s [PATH]/TrajectoriesConcatenate_1.0.kar
   example:
   [all in one line] /home/kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -pa *.dcd$$ -d /home/input/ -p /home/input/p53_wt.top 
   -pt parm7 -tt dcd -ot dcd /home/TrajectoriesConcatenate/TrajectoriesConcatenate_1.0.kar
