TrajectoriesConcatenate 

Version
   1.0

Purpose
   This workflow takes series of trajectories and concatenate them into one trajectory file 
   named _TRAJ_CONCAT_VMD_(TIME_THE_FILE_IS_CREATED)

Parameter:
   pa   stands for pattern. Default value is .*dcd$$ which will list all the .dcd files in 
        the assigned directory. NOTE: if a user is running the workflow on a command prompt, 
        the trajectory pattern is slightly different. For example, *.dcd$$ for (all dcd files) 
        and *.nc$$ for (all nc files).
   d    stands for directory. This should be a complete path that leads to the directory where 
        all .dcd files are located. A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required.
   p    stands for topology file. This should be a complete path leads to the toplogy file, for 
        example, DIRECTORY/XXX.prmtop. A complete path is ABSOLUTELY required
   pt   topology type. Some of the acceptable values are parm7 for Amber topology files and psf 
        for CHARMM topology files. Default value is parm7
   tt   trajectory type. Some of the acceptable values are dcd for NAMD trajectories and pdb for 
        PDB files. Default value is dcd.
   ot   output trajectory type. In here, users indicate the type of output trajectories they want. 
        Default value is dcd.
   f    first frame. This parameter tells vmd where to start extrapolating trajectories. It will 
        apply to all the individual trajectory files. Default value is 0 (starting from the first frame)
   l    last frame. This parameter tells vmd where to stop extrapolating trajectories. It will 
        apply to all the individual trajectory files. Default value is -1 (ending at the last frame)
   s    stride. This parameter tells vmd how many frames to be strided. For example, s = 2 means 
        take every other frames while s = 1 means to take all the frames. Default value is 1.

Input & Output
   
   Inputs are MD simulations trajectory files and output is one trajectory file named 
   _TRAJ_CONCAT_VMD_(TIME_THE_FILE_IS_CREATED). Sample inputs and outputs are available as a part
   of the download. They are in the input and output folders, respectively.

Operating System Requirement
   
   Linux or
   Mac

Notes
   This workflow utilize VMD to concatenate trajectories. VMD only allows dcd, pdb, crd as trajectory 
   outputs; therefore, our workflow can only support outputs in these formats.
