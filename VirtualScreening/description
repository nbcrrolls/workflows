Purpose
   This workflow takes a list of receptor and ligand PDBs from a receptor directory and a  ligand directory, respectively and convert them to Vina input files (PDBQT). Each receptor is paired with a ligand to create an N(numbers of ligand) by M(numbers of receptors) matrix. Each pair of inputs will then pass to Vina for docking. Users can choose either to run Vina locally or on the NBCR web server in the Vina actor.
Required Software
   Kepler 2.4 or above
   Kepler Trunk verison (OPTIONAL)
